                Hi! My name is Christopher Ellis. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am a graduate from the  University of Utah with a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Studies with minors in Business and German. I have extensive experience in the realm of customer service. I have worked in retail,hospitality, insurance and automotive industries along with IT help desk support. I am well versed in communicating effectively via email, phone and in-person with all levels of management, technical and non-technical personnel, and of course customers. I strive to provide five-star customer service in all that I do whether it's helping someone make a reservation for their perfect vacation or it's simply mounting and balancing tires to perfection for a customer's car.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently studying Web Development. The skills I have acquired, such as active listening and a keen attention to detail will complement the skills I will learn on my journey to becoming a developer. 
            </p>
