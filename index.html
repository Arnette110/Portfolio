                    Hi! My name is Christopher Ellis. I am currently studying Web Development! I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Studies with minors in Business and German. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I have extensive experience in the realm of customer service. I have worked in retail,hospitality, insurance and automotive industries along with IT help desk support. I am well versed in communicating effectively via email, phone and in-person with all levels of management, technical and non-technical personnel, and of course customers. I strive to provide five-star customer service in all that I do whether it's helping someone make a reservation for their perfect vacation or it's simply mounting and balancing tires to perfection for a customer's car.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my free-time I like to paint, play video games. I also enjoy golfing with my wife in the summer months and skiing/snowboarding in the winter.
                </p>
